- 👋 Hi, I’m Candice (@Bit-Uva-Nerd).
- 👀 I’m interested in data sets of all kinds, programming languages, tips & tricks, and any advice on getting started in the data analysis world.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up a bachelor's degree in data science (business track) from Ariozona State University, and I'm looking to learn, practice, and document projects for my portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a wide variety of projects!  If you need an extra hand, and you're willing to help a student get some experience, hit me up!
